## What are modules or plugins for WooCommerce?

A module, or plugin, is a programmed component that is added to WordPress to extend its functionalities. They act as extensions that allow you to customize and adapt the platform to very specific needs.

The main advantage of extending WooCommerce through module development is that it is done in a structured and secure way, without the need to modify the platform's core code. This is crucial because:

* **Maintainability:**
    * WooCommerce updates will not affect custom modules, as long as they are well developed. This ensures that your store continues to function correctly after each update.
* **Security:**
    * Avoiding modification of the core code reduces the risk of introducing errors or security vulnerabilities. Modules allow you to keep the original WooCommerce code intact, which guarantees greater stability.
* **Flexibility:**
    * Modules allow you to add or remove functionalities easily and quickly. If your business needs change, you can adapt your store accordingly without having to rebuild it from scratch.
* **Organization:**
    * Keeping customizations separate from the core code allows for better code organization, allowing future code revisions to be faster and more effective.

## Why develop custom WooCommerce modules?

* **Unique functionalities:** We create modules that add specific functionalities that are not found in standard WooCommerce modules.
* **Adaptation to your needs:** We customize the store to adapt it to the workflow and unique needs of your business.
* **Improvement of the user experience:** We develop modules that improve navigation, the purchase process, and other aspects of the user experience.
* **Integration with other systems:** We create modules that integrate WooCommerce with other systems that your business uses, such as ERPs, CRMs, or warehouse management systems.

### Examples of functionalities and projects

* **Advanced product customization module:** Allows customers to customize products with more complex options, such as custom designs or interactive configurators.
* **Custom subscription management module:** Adapts the subscription system to the specific needs of your business, with flexible billing options and advanced management.
* **Dynamic promotions and discounts module:** Create personalized promotions that are shown to customers based on their purchase history or other criteria.
* **Modules for connecting with ERPS and CRPS:** to have better synchronization between the web and the business management program.
* **Fee management modules:** for managing companies that charge fees to their customers.
