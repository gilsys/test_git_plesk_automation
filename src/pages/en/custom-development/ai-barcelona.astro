      <p class="text-muted">
        An Open Source Large Language Model (LLM) is a large-scale learning model made available to the public with
        open-source code. This allows companies to download, customize, and install the model on their own servers,
        ensuring complete control over data and applications. Unlike commercial solutions, Open Source LLMs offer full
        flexibility and eliminate dependencies on third-party providers.
